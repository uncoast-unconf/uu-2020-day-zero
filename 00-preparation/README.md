# Preparation

The thought is that we will have four weekly "assignments" in the runup to the Unconf itself.

We want to do this to give everyone a chance to arrive at the Unconf in roughly the same shape, confident to get started.

We should emphasize that if *you* are experienced with RStudio, R, git, and GitHub, and you like your current set-up, please proceed undisturbed (as Jenny Bryan might say).

The weekly plan is:

- Week 0: [RStudio and GitHub](00-rstudio-github/README.md)
- Week 1: [R and git](01-r-git/README.md)
- Week 2: [devtools and Rtools](02-devtools-rtools/README.md)
- Week 3: [usethis, Github PAT, and checkover](03-usethis/README.md)

Each week will also have a screencast demonstrating the tasks.
