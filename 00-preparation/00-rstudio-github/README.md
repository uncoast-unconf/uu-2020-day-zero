# RStudio and GitHub

[Slides](00-rstudio-github.html)

---

Our motivation is to get folks acquainted, or re-acquainted, with their RStudio IDE and their GitHub account.

We would like folks to use the version 1.2 of the RStudio IDE (or at least to have access to the Terminal tab).

As well, as [Jenny Byran helpfully pointed out](https://github.com/uncoast-unconf/uu-2019-day-zero/issues/8#issuecomment-473067027), it will be good that folks not only have a GitHub account, it will be useful that they have access to their login credentials.
